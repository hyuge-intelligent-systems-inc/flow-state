## üß† FlowState Philosophy in Action

### "Most productivity apps assume you need to be optimized. FlowState assumes you need to be understood."

You'll see this philosophy throughout:

1. **No Pressure**: Sessions can be ended anytime, no minimum requirements
2. **Honest Assessment**: "Moderate confidence" vs claiming high accuracy
3. **User Interpretation**: "What does this pattern mean to you?" approach
4. **Failure Planning**: Acknowledges interruptions and low-energy days
5. **Individual Differences**: Accommodates various work styles and circumstances
