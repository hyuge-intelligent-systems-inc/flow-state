### 2. Voice Activation - Implemented
- **Speech Recognition Integration**: Added full Web Speech API support

  - Say tag and sub-tag: "work client project"
  - Say "start" to begin tracking session
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual indicator when listening for voice commands
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works with Chrome and other WebKit browsers
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation when speech recognition unavailable

## Voice Activation Features

### How Voice Control Works
1. **Click "Start Voice Control"** - Activates speech recognition
2. **Say your tags** - Example: "work client project" or "learning react"
3. **Say "start"** - Automatically begins the session
4. **Visual feedback** - Red dot indicates active listening

### Voice Commands Supported
- **Tag Setting**: "work client project", "learning python", "exercise cardio"
- **Session Control**: "start", "begin" (triggers session start)
- **Auto-parsing**: Converts speech to main_tag and sub_tag automatically

### Technical Implementation
- Uses Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition)
- Continuous listening with interim results
- Smart command parsing for tag extraction
- Automatic form population from voice input
- Error handling and graceful fallbacks

## Enhanced Multi-Session System (Emoji-Free)

### Core Features
- **Multiple Concurrent Sessions**: Track unlimited parallel activities
- **User-Defined Tagging**: Flexible main_tag + sub_tag system

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live session cards with duration timers

### Clean UI Design

- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Easy to scan and understand
- **Accessible Design**: Screen reader friendly
- **Professional Aesthetics**: Suitable for business environments

## Technical Updates

### Frontend Changes
```javascript
// Voice Recognition Integration
const initializeSpeechRecognition = () => {
  const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
  // ... implementation
};

// Voice Command Processing
const processVoiceCommand = (command) => {
  if (command.includes('start') || command.includes('begin')) {
    handleStartSession();
  }
  // Parse tags from speech
};
```

### Backend API (Emoji-Free)
