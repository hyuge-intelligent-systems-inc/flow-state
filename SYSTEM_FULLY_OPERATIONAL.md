The AI now provides personalized insights based on your unique tagging:

```
"Most time spent on #work activities"
"You focus best during #learning activities" 
"#exercise activities give you the most energy"
"Good diversity with 6 different activity types"
```

Sub-tag analysis:
```
#work/client-meeting: High focus (4.2/5), Moderate energy (3.8/5)
#learning/react: Excellent focus (4.8/5), Good energy (4.1/5)
#exercise/cardio: High energy (4.9/5), Good focus (4.0/5)
```
