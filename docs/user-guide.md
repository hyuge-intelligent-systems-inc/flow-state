FlowState User Guide
Your Personal Productivity Companion That Respects Your Agency
Welcome to FlowState
FlowState is designed to help you understand and optimize your productivity patterns while maintaining complete control over your data and decisions. Unlike other productivity apps, FlowState never tells you what to do—instead, it provides insights and suggestions that you can use as you see fit.
Getting Started
First Launch
When you first open FlowState, you'll see a simple, clean interface with just the basics:

A timer for tracking work sessions
Simple task categories
Basic daily summary

This is intentional. FlowState starts simple and earns complexity as you demonstrate you want more sophisticated features.
Your First Week
Day 1-3: Learning Your Rhythms

Use the basic timer to track work sessions
Add simple task names and categories
Rate your energy and focus (1-10) after each session
No pressure—just get comfortable with the basics

Day 4-7: Discovering Patterns

All patterns come with confidence levels: "Based on 5 sessions, confidence: moderate"
You decide what patterns mean and whether they're accurate

Troubleshooting
Common Questions
"FlowState seems too simple"
This is intentional. Productivity tools should get out of your way. More features unlock as you demonstrate you want them.
"The AI suggestions don't seem accurate"
FlowState AI starts with limited data and improves over time. Check the confidence levels—early suggestions will have low confidence. You can always override or ignore suggestions.
"I want to see more detailed analytics"
Detailed analytics unlock after 2-4 weeks of consistent use. You can also manually enable them in Settings → Interface Complexity.
"My patterns don't match the insights"
You know yourself better than any algorithm. FlowState insights are suggestions, not judgments. Trust your own observations and modify or ignore conflicting insights.
Data Issues
"My data seems incorrect"

Check confidence levels on insights
Look at sample sizes (insights need 10+ data points to be meaningful)
Remember that patterns change over time
You can manually correct any data entries

"I want to start over"

Individual sessions: Delete from the session list
Categories of data: Settings → Data Management → Delete Category
Everything: Settings → Data Management → Complete Reset (requires confirmation)

Technical Support
App Performance

FlowState prioritizes reliability over flashy features
If the app is slow, try disabling advanced features in Settings
All core features work offline

Data Sync Issues

FlowState stores data locally first
Sync happens in the background when available
Check your privacy settings if team features aren't working

Best Practices
Getting the Most from FlowState
Be Honest About Your Patterns

Track actual work time, not idealized time
Rate energy and focus honestly
Note interruptions and distractions
Record what actually happened, not what you planned

Trust Your Own Observations

Your insights matter more than algorithm suggestions
Modify patterns that don't feel right
Add context that FlowState can't detect
Use the app as a mirror, not a judge

Start Small and Build

Focus on consistent basic tracking first
Add complexity only when you see value
Don't feel pressured to use every feature
Productivity is personal—customize for your needs

Sustainable Productivity
Work With Your Natural Rhythms

Notice when you naturally feel most focused
Protect your high-energy time for important work
Plan routine tasks for lower-energy periods
Take breaks when your body asks for them

Focus on Systems, Not Goals

Build consistent daily practices
Optimize your environment for focus
Reduce decision fatigue where possible
Create boundaries that protect your time

Maintain Perspective

Productivity serves your life goals, not the other way around
Some days will be less productive—that's normal
Relationships and health matter more than optimization
Use FlowState to support your values, not replace them

Remember
FlowState is designed to empower your productivity, not optimize it for you. You maintain complete control over your data, your insights, and your decisions. The app serves you—not the other way around.
Your productivity journey is unique. FlowState provides the tools and insights to help you understand yourself better, but you're always the expert on your own work and life.
Use what helps, ignore what doesn't, and remember that the best productivity system is the one you'll actually use consistently.
Happy flowing!
